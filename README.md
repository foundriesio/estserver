# EST Server

The project is an open source implementation of the Enrollment over Secure Transport
(EST) protocol as defined in [RFC 7030](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030.html)
with added notes from [RFC 8951](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8951) and
[RFC 8996](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8996).
The primary use for this server is to allow Linux microPlatform devices to
renew their certificates after they've been deployed to production.

## Key Features from RFC 7030

* 4.1 Distribution of CA Certificates `/cacerts`
* 4.2.1 Client certificate enrollement `/simpleenroll`
* 4.2.2 Client certificate renewal `/simplereenroll`

## Deviations from RFC 7030

As this project's primary aim is handling device certificate renewal, optional
features of the RFC have been omitted including:

* 4.3 - CMC
* 4.4 - Server side key generation
* 4.5 - CSR attributes

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Run `make check` to verify changes will pass CI.

## Building

The simple "standalone" server can be built with:

`make bin/estserver`

## Using

TLS certificates for the server can be generate by using the helper script
`contrib/mk-tls-keypair.sh`. Your factory's PKI directory  was generated
with a `create_ca` script. Once a CA is created, you can upload/authorize
it with:

```bash
fioctl keys ca show --just-device-cas > /tmp/cas.pem
cat <new-ca.pem> >> /tmp/cas.pem
fioctl keys ca update /tmp/cas.pem
fioctl keys ca show --just-device-cas > client-cas.pem
```

Then run the server with:

```bash
$ ./bin/estserver \
    -root-cert <pkidir>/factory_ca.pem \
    -tls-cert <pkidir>/local-tls.pem \
    -tls-key <pkidir>/local-tls.key \
    -ca-cert <pkidir>/local-ca.pem  \
    -ca-key <pkidir>/local-ca.key \
    -client-cas  client-cas.pem
```

TODO - point to fioconfig once implementation is merged
